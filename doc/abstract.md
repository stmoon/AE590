## Abstract

The civilian drones are useful in a wide variety of tasks for reconnaissance, observation and monitoring. The deployment in urban environments, however, has so far been limited due to the collision and many contingency scenarios what we do not expected. Even though SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) method has been studied for long time, this technology cannot cover unstructured scenarios. Recently, the data-driven approach like Dronet[1] becomes popular because it is based on the big data. However, it is not suitable for our situation in Korea because these training data to learn road or trail is based on road data of the Europe. In addition, this network model is just regarded navigation using road data recognition as regression problem and does not consider uncertainty. In this term project, we would like to obtain the local road dataset of direction information in specific area and compare with previous research results. Finally, we would like to improve road recognition network model in Europe model as well as in Korea model.
